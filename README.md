### [Description](#table-of-contents)
I have built an API database that is similar to other social networks, where you can add friends, create posts (thoughts), and users can comment on posts you have made (reactions). You are able to use the CRUD framework to Create, Read, Update, and Delete all of these actions. 



### [Installation](#table-of-contents)
To get started, please run "npm i" in the terminal to download all the dependencies required. This is strictly a server side application, so you will need insomnia to see this in action



### [Usage](#table-of-contents)
After installing the dependencies and insomnia we can run this application. Start by opening the terminal, and type "npm run watch" to start this application. Please follow the walkthough video to see the crud operations in action.
